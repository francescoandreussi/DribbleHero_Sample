# DribbleHero_Sample
 Simple dribbling game created with Unreal Engine 5

# How to play

- The character moves forward with increasing speed over time...so be as quick as you can!
- You can control it with WASD
- Pick up the Cones on the pitch
- If you miss one, the game is over
- If you reach the end of the pitch, you won!

# TODO:

- Add Pause Menu and Play/Pause mechanism
- Add Start Menu with options (game difficulty, music & SFX volume etc.)
- Add "Play Again" Menu at the end of the game
- Add Bonus Level with Shot-on-Goal drill (Gameplay tbd)
